### Update : 30/12/23
Bit closer, still missing 2 things that I know of, but I remembered to turn the questions back on.

### Written : 5/11/23
This challenge is regrettably incomplete at this time, basic functionality is present but some things are missing or not working properly.
I aim to fix this within the next few days.
